Project Name: Nightclub - People Management System  
Created by: Edxio Kraudy  
Date: Wednesday Jan 1, 2025

## Problem Statement
Richard is a new owner of a local Disc Jockey nightclub that  has become very popular because of its 
very expensive  equipment, fantastic selection of food & beverage, a great  sound system for influencers & DJs, 
and state-of-the-art flooring with a 10K yellow gold diamond perimeter. It runs in the evenings only 365 days a year, 
available for all adults interested in having a great time. He has a good problem in  his hands: there is a big waiting 
list that is eagerly waiting to sign up and start singing, eating & having a great time!

He has called upon the excellent influencer, disc jockey, fitness instructor & software engineer Edxio for some
assistance in building out a solution for a brand new people  management system, specifically with building out software
and logic that queues up prospective customers by retrieving the first people who digitally reserve a spot to the nightclubâ€™s
best sections, with private access to special DJ booth activities & even a private chef!

## Design Considerations:
- The max capacity of the nightclub is 7,000 people
- There are 2,000 people ready to go on the first
  night, with 4,000 people in a waitlist queue
- Once the users have been chosen from the waitlist
  queue, they must be removed and stored elsewhere
  permanently
- Tracking day-over-day performance

## Overview
- Guest, NightClub, and PerformanceTracker classes created
- NightClubAdmission acts as the TesterClass
- Test directory has been created for unit tests
